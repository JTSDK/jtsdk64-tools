# Prerequisites

The only prerequisite to running the `JTSDK64 Tools Installer` is the need for an [Qt Account][]. This is a rescent change
is their open-source use policy which prevents anonymous downloading of components via their installer.

!!! note
    The `Offline Installer` is no longer available to non-commercial users, thus, `JTSDK64-Tools` will use the `Online Installer` exclusively. See [Qt Installer Details][] for more information.

## Qt Account Registration

To create and validate a service account, perform the following:

- [Register][] for an account
- Use a valid email address during registration
- After creating the account, check your email
- Using the email sent from registration, activate the account

Anytime you use the Qt Online Installer or Qt Maintenance Tool, you will need the credentials provided during registration

## Security Note

!!! caution
    It is entirly up to the user what to use, however, it is highly recomended that you provide unique credentials for your [Qt Account][]. Do **`NOT`** use a sensitive password, or one that you have used elsewhere.
